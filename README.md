# EuroGames
This project has been realized for the DataBases Exam. It is a Java GUI which interacts with the DB using JDBC.  
<br>
It is possibile to perform the following operations on the DB via the app: ```SELECT```, ```INSERT```, ```UPDATE```, ```DELETE``` and whatever ```CUSTOM QUERY``` you can come up with.

## Demo
